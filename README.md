# Cryptography-of-images-and-Template-Matching
This is a project written in C about encrypting and decrypting an image after a unique code and template matching after given images with templates.
<br>
<h6>Cryptography</h6>
The initial image was: <br><img src="What does the program/peppers.bmp" width="500"> <br>
And after encrypting: <br><img src="What does the program/encrypted_peppers.bmp" width="500"> <br>
Then you can decrypt it to the initial form if you have the right code. If you don't have the code which was introduced to create the encrypted image, you would not be able to decrypte it.
<br><br>
<h6>Template matching</h6>
The templates we have to detect are numbers.<br><img src="Templates/cifra6.bmp" width="100"> <br>
And the image where we will detect the templates is this: <br><img src="What does the program/test.bmp" width="500"> <br>
After running the program every occurance of a number will have a layout in a different color. <br><img src="What does the program/test_grayscale_template_matching.bmp" width="500"> <br>
